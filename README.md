# portal 2 custom bowling map
This is the files used in creating my portal 2 custom bowling map, build with Valve's Portal 2 Authoring Tools - Beta program with its trailer released as an youtube video here: https://youtu.be/rZMZnZ2rWWI 

To get it set up correctly for editing you need to place the following files and folders according to the game's main directory, which is as follows for if you have installed the game in your main steam folder or on a seperate drive (D:\ in this example):
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal 2\
- D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Portal 2\

The files should be added to the following folders (create them if they do not exist):
- "soer_instances" -> sdk_content\maps\
- "soer_materials" -> portal2\materials\
- "soer_scripts" -> portal2\scripts\vscripts\
- "mp_coop_bowling.vmf, mp_coop_bowling.log, mp_coop_bowling.prt" -> sdk_content\maps\

These files are allowed to be altered and used by everyone for their own projects as long as crediting to the creator and link to this Github page is within the maps's steam workshop page's description or in a readme file if it is not uploaded to the steam workshop.
